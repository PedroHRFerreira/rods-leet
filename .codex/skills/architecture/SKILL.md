# Architecture

Detected stack: React TypeScript

## Rules

1. Reuse existing modules, layers, and naming before creating new structure.
2. Keep transport, adapter, domain, and UI responsibilities separated.
3. Do not add abstractions unless they remove real duplication or clarify ownership.
4. Document any boundary change in the final response.
5. When a feature spans domain, rendered UI, and routing and can be split safely, use the `parallel-delivery` skill.
